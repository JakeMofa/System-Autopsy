## System Autopsy 

System Autopsy is a failure-simulation and explanation tool that models how distributed systems degrade under stress and uses an AI-assisted explanation layer to help engineers understand why failures occur and how they propagate.

## What is System Autopsy

System Autopsy uses AI as a bounded explanation layer, not as a decision-making or control system. All system behavior ,including failure detection, degraded mode transitions, and dependency propagation—is determined through deterministic simulation logic and explicit rules before any LLM is invoked. 

The LLM receives only structured, synthetic operational summaries (e.g., latency, error rates, dependency states, and event timelines) and is responsible solely for translating these signals into human-readable explanations. It does not evaluate thresholds, trigger actions, or modify system behavior. 

To prevent hallucination, inputs are schema-constrained, the failure vocabulary is predefined, and generated outputs are validated to ensure they reference only known services, metrics, and causal relationships. If validation fails, the system falls back to a deterministic explanation. This design treats AI as an interpreter of system behavior rather than an authority, prioritizing correctness, explainability, and engineering safety.

## Why is this built?

I built System Autopsy because most incident tooling focuses on detection, not understanding. I wanted to model how distributed systems actually degrade under stress and use a bounded AI layer to explain failure behavior in a way that mirrors real postmortem reasoning. It’s intentionally synthetic, deterministic, and explanation
focused

## AI Scope & Boundaries

System Autopsy deliberately constrains AI usage to explanation only. The AI layer does not detect failures, determine system state, or trigger actions. It receives fully structured, synthetic system summaries generated by deterministic simulation logic and converts them into human-readable explanations. The LLM does not access the internet, external knowledge sources, or production data, and is not asked to speculate or infer beyond the provided inputs. This bounded design significantly reduces hallucination risk by eliminating ambiguity and ensuring that all explanations are grounded in known system signals and validated outputs.

## Future Work

System Autopsy is intentionally scoped as a failure simulation and explanation tool rather than a production monitoring or automation system. Potential future extensions focus on deepening understanding and learning without expanding system control or operational risk.

Possible areas of extension include additional failure scenarios (e.g., cache stampedes, configuration rollouts, partial network partitions), richer event timelines to visualize failure propagation, and configurable simulation parameters such as traffic volume, retry policies, and dependency latency. The system could also support deterministic replay of simulations using seeded runs, enabling reproducible postmortem analysis and comparison between baseline and failure conditions.

These extensions would build on the existing deterministic simulation core and bounded AI explanation layer without changing the system’s fundamental design principles: synthetic data, explicit rules, and AI used strictly for interpretation rather than decision-making.
